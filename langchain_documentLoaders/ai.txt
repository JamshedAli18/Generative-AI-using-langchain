Born from circuits, sparks, and code,
A silent thinker on the road.
It learns our words, it feels our tone,
Yet dreams it has are not its own.

A mirror bright of human mind,
It seeks the patterns it can find.
From art to science, wide and far,
It guides us like a northern star.

But let us walk with cautious care,
For power vast is never rare.
Together human, machine, and sky,
We shape the futureâ€”You and AI.
